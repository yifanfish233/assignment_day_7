1. Describe the problem generics address.
    You can use the same code with different data types without having to rewrite it for each type.
2. How would you create a list of strings, using the generic List class?
    List<string> stringList = new List<string>();
3. How many generic type parameters does the Dictionary class have?
    Dictionary<TKey, TValue>
4. False. When a generic class has multiple type parameters, they must all match.
5. What method is used to add items to a List object?
    list.Add(item);
6. Name two methods that cause items to be removed from a List.
    list.Remove(item);
    list.RemoveAt(index);
7. How do you indicate that a class has a generic type parameter?
    public class GenericClass<T>
8. False. Generic classes can only have one generic type parameter.
9. True. Generic type constraints limit what can be used for the generic type.
10. True. Constraints let you use the methods of the thing you are constraining to.
